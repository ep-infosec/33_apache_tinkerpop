# Gremlin.Net Template

This dotnet template helps getting started with [Gremlin.Net](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-DotNet) - the .NET Gremlin Language Variant (GLV) of Apache TinkerPopâ„¢. It creates a new C# console project that shows how to connect to a [Gremlin Server](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server) with Gremlin.Net.

## Installation

You can install the template with the dotnet CLI tool:

```bash
dotnet new -i Gremlin.Net.Template
```

## Creating a project using the template

After the template is installed, a new project based on this template can be installed:

```bash
dotnet new gremlin
```

You can specify the output directory for the new project which will then also be used as the name of the created project:

```bash
dotnet new gremlin -o MyFirstGremlinProject
```
